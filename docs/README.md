# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide provides a quick overview of how we initiate, plan, execute, track, and continuously improve our projects. Whether you're a new team member or a contributor, this introduction will help you understand our workflows, key roles, and essential practices.

## How We Manage Projects

At OctoAcme, we follow a customer-first, iterative delivery approach with clear ownership and data-informed decisions. Projects move through five key phases: **Initiation** begins with a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and high-level timeline—requiring approval before moving forward. **Planning** involves a kickoff meeting where we break work into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimate effort, create a release plan, and document our Definition of Done. During **Execution and Tracking**, teams follow a regular rhythm of daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and sprint demos, using project boards (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and maintaining small, well-tested pull requests with automated CI checks. **Release and Deployment** standardizes our path to production with pre-release requirements including passing tests, security scans, release notes, and rollback plans, followed by staged deployments through testing and production environments. Finally, **Retrospectives and Continuous Improvement** capture what went well and what could be improved after each sprint or milestone, generating 2-3 prioritized action items with clear owners to drive ongoing enhancements.

## Key Roles and Artifacts

Our cross-functional teams include **Project Managers** (PMs) who coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; **Product Managers** (PdMs) who define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; **Developers** who implement features and maintain quality through testing and code reviews; **QA/Testing** specialists who validate acceptance criteria; and **Stakeholders** who provide inputs and approvals. Essential artifacts include the Project Charter/One-pager, Roadmap and Release Plan, Sprint Backlog with acceptance criteria, Risk Register, and Retrospective action items. These documents serve as our single source of truth and are maintained in project repositories, with process-specific guidance stored in `.copilot/` directories for Copilot Spaces context.

## Communication and Quality Practices

Communication follows a structured cadence: weekly syncs between PM and PdM, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates, with ad-hoc escalations as needed. Our three-level escalation path moves from team-level triage to PM coordination with dependent teams, and ultimately to sponsor-level decisions for business-impacting issues. Quality assurance is built into every step through unit tests for new logic, integration and end-to-end tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI pipelines, and manual QA for feature acceptance when needed. We track velocity, burndown, and the success metrics defined in each Project One-pager, using dashboards to monitor errors, latency, and usage patterns. Risk management is proactive—we maintain a Risk Register with impact assessment, likelihood ratings, mitigation plans, and weekly status reviews to address dependencies and blockers before they become critical issues.
