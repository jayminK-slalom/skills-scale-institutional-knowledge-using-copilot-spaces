# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by PM, attended by Sponsor if available)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager, supported by BA for complex requirements)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) with development team
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) collaboratively
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. UX Designer creates initial wireframes/prototypes for user-facing features (if applicable)
8. Scrum Master sets up Agile ceremonies and team norms (if using Agile/Scrum)

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
