# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Scrum Master facilitates the retrospective (in Agile teams) or PM facilitates (in non-Agile teams)
- Ensure all roles participate: Developers, Product Manager, BA, UX Designer as applicable
- Document action items with clear owners and due dates

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Scrum Master tracks completion of retrospective action items and reports on progress
- Celebrate wins and share learnings across the organization
